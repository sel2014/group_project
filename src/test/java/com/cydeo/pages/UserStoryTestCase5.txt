Feature: Verify error message when attempting to sign up with an existing email address

  Sign up with existing email address.
  As a user, when I am on the home page and when I Click on 'Signup / Login' button,
  I should be able to see  'New User Signup!' is visible. When I enter my name and
  already registered email address and click on 'Signup' button, I should see the
  error message 'Email Address already exist!' is visible.
